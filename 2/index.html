            <p class="sectionTag text-big">THE CENTRE LATHE </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> A lathe may or may not have legs, which sit on the floor and elevate
                the lathe bed to a working height. A lathe may be small and sit on a workbench or table, not requiring a
                stand.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>Almost all lathes have a bed, which is almost always a horizontal
            beam, although CNC lathes commonly
            have an inclined or vertical beam for a bed to ensure that swarf, or chips, falls free of the bed.
            Woodturning lathes specialized for turning large bowls often have no bed or tail stock, merely a
            free-standing headstock and a cantilevered tool rest.

            At one end of the bed (almost always the left, as the operator faces the lathe) is a headstock. The
            headstock contains high-precision spinning bearings. Rotating within the bearings is a horizontal axle,
            with an axis parallel to the bed, called the spindle. Spindles are often hollow and have an interior
            Morse taper on the spindle nose (i.e., facing to the right / towards the bed) by which work-holding
            accessories may be mounted to the spindle. Spindles may also have arrangements for work-holding on the
            left-hand end of the spindle with other tooling arrangements for particular tasks. (i.e., facing away
            from the main bed) end, or may have a hand-wheel or other accessory mechanism on their outboard end.
            Spindles are powered and impart motion to the workpiece.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>The spindle is driven either by foot power from a treadle and
            flywheel or by a belt or gear drive from a
            power source such as electric motor or overhead line shafts. In most modern lathes this power source is
            an integral electric motor, often either in the headstock, to the left of the headstock, or beneath the
            headstock, concealed in the stand.

            In addition to the spindle and its bearings, the headstock often contains parts to convert the motor
            speed into various spindle speeds. Various types of speed-changing mechanism achieve this, from a cone
            pulley or step pulley, to a cone pulley with back gear (which is essentially a low range, similar in net
            effect to the two-speed rear of a truck), to an entire gear train similar to that of a manual-shift
            automotive transmission. Some motors have electronic rheostat-type speed controls, which obviates cone
            pulleys or gears.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>The counterpoint to the headstock is the tailstock, sometimes
            referred to as the loose head, as it can
            be positioned at any convenient point on the bed by sliding it to the required area. The tail-stock
            contains a barrel, which does not rotate, but can slide in and out parallel to the axis of the bed and
            directly in line with the headstock spindle. The barrel is hollow and usually contains a taper to
            facilitate the gripping of various types of tooling. Its most common uses are to hold a hardened steel
            center, which is used to support long thin shafts while turning, or to hold drill bits for drilling
            axial holes in the work piece. Many other uses are possible.
            Metalworking lathes have a carriage (comprising a saddle and apron) topped with a cross-slide, which is
            a flat piece that sits crosswise on the bed and can be cranked at right angles to the bed. Sitting atop
            the cross slide is usually another slide called a compound rest, which provides 2 additional axes of
            motion, rotary and linear. Atop that sits a toolpost, which holds a cutting tool, which removes material
            from the workpiece. There may or may not be a leadscrew, which moves the cross-slide along the bed.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>Woodturning and metal spinning lathes do not have cross-slides, but
            rather have banjos, which are flat
            pieces that sit crosswise on the bed. The position of a banjo can be adjusted by hand; no gearing is
            involved. Ascending vertically from the banjo is a tool-post, at the top of which is a horizontal
            tool-rest. In woodturning, hand tools are braced against the tool rest and levered into the workpiece.
            In metal spinning, the further pin ascends vertically from the tool rest and serves as a fulcrum against
            which tools may be levered into the workpiece.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">CENTRAIL DRILL MACHINE</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> </p>Power drills</p>
            Drills powered by electricity (or more rarely, compressed air) are the most common tools in woodworking and
            machining shops.


            Cordless drill
            Electric drills can be corded (fed from an electric outlet through a power cable) or cordless (fed by
            rechargeable electric batteries). The latter have removable battery packs that can be swapped to allow
            uninterrupted drilling while recharging.

            A popular use of hand-held power drills is to set screws into wood, through the use of screwdriver bits.
            Drills optimized for this purpose have a clutch to avoid damaging the slots on the screw head.

            Pistol-grip drill - the most common hand-held power drill type.
            Right-angle drill - used to drill or drive screws in tight spaces.
            Hammer drill - combines rotary motion with a hammer action for drilling masonry. The hammer action may be
            engaged or disengaged as required.
            Drill press - larger power drill with a rigid holding frame, standalone mounted on a bench

            A heavy duty rotary hammer drill
            Rotary hammer combines a primary dedicated hammer mechanism with a separate rotation mechanism, and is used
            for more substantial material such as masonry or concrete.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> </p>Impact drills</p>
            Main article: Impact wrench
            Also known as impact wrenches, is a form of drill that incorporates a hammer motion along with the rotating
            motion of a conventional drill. The hammering aspect of the impact drill occurs when the power of the motor
            cannot turn the bolt it will begin exerting bursts of force to "hammer" the bolt in the desired direction.
            These drills are commonly used to secure long bolts or screws into wood, metal, and concrete, as well as
            loosening ceased or over torqued bolts. Impact drills come in two major types, pneumatic and electric, and
            vary in size depending on application. Electric impact drills are most often found cordless and are widely
            used in construction, automobile repair, and fabrication. These electric drills are preferred over the
            pneumatic driven because of their maneuverability and ease of use. Pneumatic impact drills rely on air and
            have to remain connected to an air source to maintain power. The chuck on impact drills is different from
            the conventional handheld power drill. The chuck acts more as a collet with a hexagonal shape in which the
            bits and drivers lock into. Impact drivers can also be used to bore holes like a standard pistol grip drill,
            but this requires a special bit that will lock into the hexagonal collet. The design of the impact drills
            are almost identical to modern pistol grip power drills with only one major difference. Impact drills have a
            shorter, skinnier, stubby receiver where the collet is located compared to the larger tapered chuck on a
            conventional drill. This allows the user to fit in smaller places that a normal drill would not. Impact
            drills are not great in regards to torque and speed control. Most handheld drills have a variable speed
            option, whereas most impact drills have a fixed torque and speed. Impact drills are not designed for
            precision work due to this lack of adjustability</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> </p>Hammer drill</p>
            Main article: Hammer drill
            The hammer action of a hammer drill is provided by two cam plates that make the chuck rapidly pulse forward
            and backward as the drill spins on its axis. This pulsing (hammering) action is measured in Blows Per Minute
            (BPM) with 10,000 or more BPMs being common. Because the combined mass of the chuck and bit is comparable to
            that of the body of the drill, the energy transfer is inefficient and can sometimes make it difficult for
            larger bits to penetrate harder materials such as poured concrete. A standard hammer drill accepts 6 mm (1/4
            inch) and 13 mm (1/2 inch) drill bits. The operator experiences considerable vibration, and the cams are
            generally made from hardened steel to avoid them wearing out quickly. In practice, drills are restricted to
            standard masonry bits up to 13 mm (1/2 inch) in diameter. A typical application for a hammer drill is
            installing electrical boxes, conduit straps or shelves in concrete.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> </p>Drill press</p>

            A drill press

            Drill press (then called a boring machine) boring wooden reels for winding barbed wire, 1917
            A drill press (also known as a pedestal drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a style of drill that may be
            mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models are made, some including a magnetic
            base. Major components include a base, column (or pillar), adjustable table, spindle, chuck, and drill head,
            usually driven by an electric motor. The head typically has a set of three handles radiating from a central
            hub that are turned to move the spindle and chuck vertically. The distance from the center of the chuck to
            the closest edge of the column is the throat. The swing is simply twice the throat, and the swing is how
            drill presses are classified and sold. Thus, a tool with 4" throat has an 8" swing (it can drill a hole in
            the center of an 8" work piece), and is called an 8" drill press.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> </p>Geared head</p>

            A geared head drill press, with up to eight possible speeds accessible via shift levers on the head and a
            two speed motor control immediately in front of the quill handle
            A geared head drill press transmits power from the motor to the spindle through spur gearing inside the
            machine's head, eliminating a flexible drive belt. This assures a positive drive at all times and minimizes
            maintenance. Gear head drills are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are
            higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.

            Levers attached to one side of the head are used to select different gear ratios to change the spindle
            speed, usually in conjunction with a two- or three-speed motor (this varies with the material). Most
            machines of this type are designed to be operated on three-phase electric power and are generally of more
            rugged construction than equivalently sized belt-driven units. Virtually all examples have geared racks for
            adjusting the table and head position on the column.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> </p>Radial arm</p>

            Radial arm drill press
            A radial arm drill press is a large geared-head drill press in which the head can be moved along an arm that
            radiates from the machine's column. As it is possible to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a
            radial arm drill press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This
            feature saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the machine's head than it is to
            unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be
            considerable, as the arm can swing out of the way of the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to
            place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial arm drill press, but more
            often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture.

            Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger-size
            machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial arm drill presses
            are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron.
            Radial arm drill presses are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length
            of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The radial arm drill press pictured to the
            right has a 9 inch diameter and a 3 foot long arm. The maximum throat distance of this machine would be
            approximately 36", giving a maximum swing of 72" (6 feet or 1.83 meters).</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">WELDING MACHINE</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p> Welding Machine:</p>
            MIG welding machine is used in the automotive industry to repair vehicle exhaust systems and is also
            used to construct houses and buildings. It is the most common form of industrial welding and is suitable
            for most metals. It is the preferred method for thin metals such as aluminum alloys. Mig welding uses
            electrodes consumable in contrast to other types of welding.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>ARC welding machine:</p>
            ARC welding machine is a technology that uses an electric arc that melts the metal workpiece above the
            ground with the welding device and the electrodes attached to the machine. Rod welders use a flux-coated
            welding rod with electrodes that conduct current to generate an arc and melt the metal.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>Spot Welding Machine:</p>
            Welding area (or resistance welding) is a type of electrical resistance welding machine used for welding
            various metal products, a process in which contacting metal points are combined with the heat obtained
            in resisting electrical energy. The amount of heat (energy) brought to a place is determined by the
            resistance between the electrodes and the magnitude and length of the current.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>Laser Welding Machine:</p>
            Laser welding machines are powerful welding tools used to join metal parts and thermoplastics using
            fiber laser beams. Laser welding can be used for welding thin-walled materials, precision parts,
            realized spot welding, butt welding, stitching, seal welding, and more. Products that need to be welded
            at the seams can also be used if they are available.</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>Portable Welding Machine:</p>
            Portable welding machines help professional welding keepers high and safe. Sometimes called
            semi-automation, portable welding carts make welding easier for the welder because the torch is removed
            from the welder's hand and moves in a controlled manner. This allows the burner to focus on weld
            parameters and bead construction without being placed in uncomfortable positions and reduces its
            exposure to heat and oil. By keeping the distance of the torch constant, the arc voltage remains the
            same. Speed controls keep weld beads and entry; this reduces overheating and, in turn, reduces costs.
            The distortion is controlled by maintaining the affected temperature area. Wire and gas waste are
            reduced as only limited amounts of these are used for weld beads.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">HYDRAULIC PRESS MACHINE</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> A hydraulic press is a machine press using a hydraulic cylinder to
                generate a compressive force. It uses the hydraulic equivalent of a mechanical lever, and was also
                known as a Bramah press after the inventor, Joseph Bramah, of England. He invented and was issued a
                patent on this press in 1795. As Bramah (who is also known for his development of the flush toilet)
                installed toilets, he studied the existing literature on the motion of fluids and put this knowledge
                into the development of the press.
                Hydraulic presses are commonly used for forging, clinching, moulding, blanking, punching, deep drawing,
                and metal forming operations. Hydraulic presses are also used for stretch forming, rubber pad forming,
                and powder compacting. The hydraulic press is advantageous in manufacturing, it gives the ability
                to create more intricate shapes and can be economical with materials. A hydraulic press will take up
                less space compared to a mechanical press of the same capability.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>In geology a tungsten carbide coated hydraulic press is used in the rock crushing stage of preparing
                samples for geochemical analyses in topics such as understanding the origins of volcanism.
                The room featured in Fermat's Room has a design similar to that of a hydraulic press. Boris
                Artzybasheff also created a drawing of a hydraulic press, in which the press was created out of the
                shape of a robot.

                In 2015, the Hydraulic Press Channel, a YouTube channel dedicated to crushing objects with a hydraulic
                press, was created by Lauri Vuohensilta, a factory owner from Tampere, Finland. The Hydraulic Press
                Channel has since grown to over 3 million subscribers on YouTube. There are numerous other YouTube
                channels that publish videos involving hydraulic presses that are tasked with crushing many different
                items, such as bowling balls, soda cans, plastic toys and metal tools.

                A hydraulic press features prominently in the Sherlock Holmes story "The Adventure of the Engineer's
                Thumb".</p>
