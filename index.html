            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> A lathe may or may not have legs, which sit on the floor and elevate
                the lathe bed to a working height. A lathe may be small and sit on a workbench or table, not requiring a
                stand.
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>Almost all lathes have a bed, which is almost always a horizontal
            beam, although CNC lathes commonly
            have an inclined or vertical beam for a bed to ensure that swarf, or chips, falls free of the bed.
            Woodturning lathes specialized for turning large bowls often have no bed or tail stock, merely a
            free-standing headstock and a cantilevered tool rest.

            At one end of the bed (almost always the left, as the operator faces the lathe) is a headstock. The
            headstock contains high-precision spinning bearings. Rotating within the bearings is a horizontal axle,
            with an axis parallel to the bed, called the spindle. Spindles are often hollow and have an interior
            Morse taper on the spindle nose (i.e., facing to the right / towards the bed) by which work-holding
            accessories may be mounted to the spindle. Spindles may also have arrangements for work-holding on the
            left-hand end of the spindle with other tooling arrangements for particular tasks. (i.e., facing away
            from the main bed) end, or may have a hand-wheel or other accessory mechanism on their outboard end.
            Spindles are powered and impart motion to the workpiece.</p>

            Radial arm drill press
            A radial arm drill press is a large geared-head drill press in which the head can be moved along an arm that
            radiates from the machine's column. As it is possible to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a
            radial arm drill press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This
            feature saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the machine's head than it is to
            unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be
            considerable, as the arm can swing out of the way of the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to
            place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial arm drill press, but more
            often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture.

            Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger-size
            machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial arm drill presses
            are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron.
            Radial arm drill presses are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length
            of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The radial arm drill press pictured to the
            right has a 9 inch diameter and a 3 foot long arm. The maximum throat distance of this machine would be
            approximately 36", giving a maximum swing of 72" (6 feet or 1.83 meters).</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p> Welding Machine:</p>
            MIG welding machine is used in the automotive industry to repair vehicle exhaust systems and is also
            used to construct houses and buildings. It is the most common form of industrial welding and is suitable
            for most metals. It is the preferred method for thin metals such as aluminum alloys. Mig welding uses
            electrodes consumable in contrast to other types of welding.</p>

            
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"></p>Portable Welding Machine:</p>
            Portable welding machines help professional welding keepers high and safe. Sometimes called
            semi-automation, portable welding carts make welding easier for the welder because the torch is removed
            from the welder's hand and moves in a controlled manner. This allows the burner to focus on weld
            parameters and bead construction without being placed in uncomfortable positions and reduces its
            exposure to heat and oil. By keeping the distance of the torch constant, the arc voltage remains the
            same. Speed controls keep weld beads and entry; this reduces overheating and, in turn, reduces costs.
            The distortion is controlled by maintaining the affected temperature area. Wire and gas waste are
            reduced as only limited amounts of these are used for weld beads.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">HYDRAULIC PRESS MACHINE</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> A hydraulic press is a machine press using a hydraulic cylinder to
                generate a compressive force. It uses the hydraulic equivalent of a mechanical lever, and was also
                known as a Bramah press after the inventor, Joseph Bramah, of England. He invented and was issued a
                patent on this press in 1795. As Bramah (who is also known for his development of the flush toilet)
                installed toilets, he studied the existing literature on the motion of fluids and put this knowledge
                into the development of the press.
                Hydraulic presses are commonly used for forging, clinching, moulding, blanking, punching, deep drawing,
                and metal forming operations. Hydraulic presses are also used for stretch forming, rubber pad forming,
                and powder compacting. The hydraulic press is advantageous in manufacturing, it gives the ability
                to create more intricate shapes and can be economical with materials. A hydraulic press will take up
                less space compared to a mechanical press of the same capability.
